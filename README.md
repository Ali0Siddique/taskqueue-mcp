# MCP Task Manager

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AI task management. This tool helps AI assistants handle multi-step tasks in a structured way, with user approval checkpoints.

## Features

- Task planning with multiple steps
- Progress tracking
- User approval of completed tasks
- Request completion approval
- Task details visualization

## Structure

The codebase has been refactored into a modular structure:

```
src/
├── index.ts              # Main entry point
├── server/
│   └── TaskManagerServer.ts   # Core server functionality
└── types/
    ├── index.ts          # Type definitions and schemas
    └── tools.ts          # MCP tool definitions
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

You can also set a custom path for the tasks file:

```bash
TASK_MANAGER_FILE_PATH=/path/to/tasks.json npm start
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available Operations

The TaskManager supports two main phases of operation:

### Planning Phase
- Accepts a task list (array of strings) from the user
- Stores tasks internally as a queue
- Returns an execution plan (task overview, task ID, current queue status)

### Execution Phase
- Returns the next task from the queue when requested
- Provides feedback mechanism for task completion
- Removes completed tasks from the queue
- Prepares the next task for execution

### Parameters

- `action`: "plan" | "execute" | "complete"
- `tasks`: Array of task strings (required for "plan" action)
- `taskId`: Task identifier (required for "complete" action)
- `getNext`: Boolean flag to request next task (for "execute" action)

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Planning phase
{
  action: "plan",
  tasks: ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]
}

// Execution phase
{
  action: "execute",
  getNext: true
}

// Complete task
{
  action: "complete",
  taskId: "task-123"
}
```
