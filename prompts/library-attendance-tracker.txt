Create a project plan for developing a responsive web application for public libraries to track attendance and gather feedback for digital literacy programs:

- Import digital literacy program details (drop-in, registration-required, and online sessions) from CSV files
- Track attendance for in-person and virtual sessions with simple check-in interface
- Collect participant feedback through customizable forms (rating scales, open comments)
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on tablets, phones, and desktop computers
- Administrative dashboard for librarians to monitor program statistics
- Generate reports on attendance, demographic trends, and feedback summaries
- Support for multiple library branches with different program offerings
- Role-based access control (admin, staff, program coordinators)
- Export capabilities for attendance data and feedback to CSV/Excel formats
- Ability to send automated follow-up emails to participants for feedback
- Integration with library event calendars to display upcoming digital literacy sessions
